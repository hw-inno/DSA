The repository contains my homework solutions for DSA course taught at Innopolis University in 2016 Fall semester. The tasks were to build own implementations of a common data structures and create an algorithms to process them somehow.

### [Assignment 1](Assignment1)
Covered topics: Basic data structures(List, stack, queue)

Tasks:
 1. Implement [Shunting-yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) 
 2. Implement [Monte Carlo algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm)
 - Create your own stack 
 - Create your own queue
 

### [Assignment 2](Assignment2)
Covered topics: Hashtables, algorithmic strategies, sorting

Tasks:
1. [Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)
2. Median filter
3. Count number of words in a document
- Create your own hashmap with double hashing for collisions

### [Assignment 3](Assignment3)
Covered topics: Binary search tress, AVL, red black trees, b-trees, priority queue, binary heap

Tasks:
1. Create your own [AVL tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) implementation
2. Create priority queue using array-based heap

### [Assignment 4](Assignment4)
Covered topics: Graphs, minimum spanning trees, flow in a network

1. Task1 - Implement shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra)
2. Task2 MST - Implement minimum spanning tree algorithm [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
3. Task3 Flow - Find max flow, min cut in a network [Ford-Fulkerson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm)

### Misc
Other examples and implementations.
